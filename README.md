# predict-handwriting-number
 (NOTE:“This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis”)

## Overview

`predict-handwriting-number` 
 is very simple image recognition by using Python.
 And this application doesn’t use AI libraries.
 Because I wanna study the mechanism of deep learning.
 For implementing neural networks, I refer to the following book.
 [ゼロから作るDeep Learning ―Pythonで学ぶディープラーニングの理論と実装 – 2016/9/24 斎藤 康毅]
